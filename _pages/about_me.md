Hi! My name is Logan and I am a bioinformatician in the Meshinchi Lab at Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle. I use computational skills and my knowledge of molecular biology and genomics to investigate biological questions in the field of acute myeloid leukemia. 

I am passionate about science, the outdoors and lots of other things.
